#### Changing plan  

Move the training for ML to other computer (more power)
It taking too long to forcast all ids for 28 days on local machine or google colab.

use docker and set environment to run model training  
#### EDA part  
not show much just cleaning data and some explore then rearrange data to be the right input format to the training with Prophet model
